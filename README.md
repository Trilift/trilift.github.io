- Iâ€™m currently learning **Managing Enterprise Servers**

<body align="left">In this course, I learnt how to apply my past knowledge of the Linux operating system to this course. In addition to connecting to servers via SSH, I now know how to build yaml files to perform system installations, upgrades, and other activities. I learned how to use Ansible and SSH to create scripts for managing other systems. I now understand how to improve task filtering by using tags and roles. I learned how to use Ansible roles and tasks while developing containers that are resource-efficient. This training has taught me a lot, and it will be useful in the future.</body>
